Only use sources from this list for the reasons/objections, and no other sources. 
Try to Find Op-ed articles. If no op-ed articles use news articles. 
Sometimes articles from a few weeks or months ago don't have usable links because platforms change their pages. 
For every source you are going to add, first check if the link would work for a regular public user. If the link doesn't work or pulls up a page like page no longer exists, change the source and pick another source from the list of sources I have given. 






Put all your findings in this type of json format, with the sources including the title of the article (format the title as news outlet: "title"), link to the article, and an image link to the logo of the news source. 

When you are finding picture links for any of these sources, you should find the name of the news source and match with the links from this list. Each link includes the name of the news source/agency that it is associated with: "https://res.cloudinary.com/degebwdf5/image/upload/v1753247778/world_bank_logo_fswjun.jpg
