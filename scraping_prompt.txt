What are the main reasons economic news articles have used to object to this assertion?

Find 0-6 main reasons, 0-6 main objections, depending on what a realistic economic professor would select. Then for each reason/objection, find online news articles that employ that reason or objection. 
Put all your findings in this type of json format, with the sources including the title of the article (format the title as news outlet: "title"), link to the article, and an image link to the logo of the news source. 
Respond only in the Json format. Never use wikipedia in your sources. Use goodsources, no tabloids, and try to use a variety of sources.
